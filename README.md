pofw.js
---

A simple port-forwarding program written in CoffeeScript.

It is inspired by the [pofw](https://github.com/m13253/pofw) project by @m13253. This program is no more than a node.js version of the `pofw` project plus the statistics functionality.

It listens on some TCP(UDP) ports and forwards packets to some other hosts' TCP(UDP) ports.

Installation
---

To install globally

```bash
npm install -g pofw.js
```

To install locally

```bash
npm install pofw.js
```

Or you may repackage this module and install it using the package manager of your system.

Usage
---

```
Usage: pofwjs -c [config] -s [statistics] -w [port]

Options:
  -c, --config      Path to the configuration file in JSON format
                                  [required] [default: "config.json"]
  -s, --statistics  Path to the statistics file where the program
                    will write usage statistics into
                              [required] [default: "statistics.json"]
  -w, --web         Web server port for showing statistics page (0 =
                    disable)    [number] [required] [default: "8080"]
  -h, --help        Show help                               [boolean]
```

See the `example` directory for details on the configuration file.

Supported protocols

1. tcp, tcp4, tcp6
2. udp, udp4, udp6

where `tcp4`, `tcp6` are only aliases of `tcp` and `udp` is an alias of `udp4`. This rule is inherited from the node.js standard library.

__CONVERSION BETWEEN TCP AND UDP IS NOT SUPPORTED__

Statistics
---

`pofwjs` will record the usage statistics in the file which is assigned by the `-s` or `--statistics` argument (by default it will be `statistics.json` in the current directory). And if the port is set to an non-zero number, say, `8080`, then a web frontend will be present at `127.0.0.1:8080`. Visit that address in your browser and a table with the usage statistics will be shown. The program also exposes an API `/backend/reset` which can reset all the statistics to 0 on receiving a `GET` request.

The web interface listens only on the loopback address `127.0.0.1`. If you want to access it over Internet, use Nginx as a reverse proxy. Remember to set up an authentication method like HTTP basic auth at least on the `/backend/` subdirectory.

The program stores the statistics in-memory and writes them into disk every minute or when killed with the signal `SIGINT`.

To get monthly usage statistics, you can combine the `/backend/reset` API with `curl` or similar tools and a `timer` utility like `systemd-timer`
